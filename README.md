# AWS Serverless Jenkins Terraform Module
Terraform module which creates a serverless Jenkins environment based on AWS Fargate. The following resources are created:

* Two Amazon ECS clusters
    * One utilizing the standard `FARGATE` capacity provider, which is to be used by the Jenkins controller and high priority agents.
    * One utilizing the `FARGATE_SPOT` capacity provider, which is to be used by Jenkins agents which handle lower priority jobs.
* Amazon ECS service and task for Jenkins controller.
* Jenkins controller Docker container, including the [amazon-ecs-plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/amazon-ecs-plugin).
* Amazon ECR repository for storing the above container
* Application load balancer
* Amazon Elastic Filesystem to provide stateful storage for the Jenkins controller
* AWS Backup vault and schedule to backup EFS
* AWS Cloud Map service discovery domain and entry for Jenkins controller (for agent -> controller discovery)
* IAM Roles for the above components
* Security Groups for the above components

An example is included in the `example` directory.
## Prerequisites
The following are required to deploy this Terraform module

1. Terraform 13+ - Download at https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
1. Docker 19+ - Download at https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
1. A VPC with at least two public and two private subnets.
1. An SSL certificate to associate with the Application Load Balancer. It's recommended to use an ACM certificate. This is not done by the main Terraform module. However, the example in the `example` directory uses the [public AWS ACM module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/acm/aws/latest) to create the ACM certificate and pass it to the Serverless Jenkins module. You may choose to do it this way or explicitly pass the ARN of a certificate that you had previously created or imported into ACM.
1. An admin password for Jenkins must be stored in SSM Parameter store. This parameter must be of type `SecureString` and have the name `jenkins-pwd`
1. Terraform must be bootstrapped. This means that a state S3 bucket and a state locking DynamoDB table must be initialized.

## Deployment
This is packaged as a Terraform module, which means it's not directly deployable. However, there is a deployable example in the `example` directory. To deploy the example:

1. Ensure you have met all the Prerequisites
1. If necessary, execute the bootstrap in the bootstrap directory. This will create a Terraform state bucket & state locking table. This step may be unnecessary if you already have an established Terraform environment.
1. copy `vars.sh.example` to `vars.sh`
1. Edit the variables in `vars.sh` as necessary giving all details specific to your environment (VPC, subnets, state bucket & state locking table, etc.)
1. Run `deploy_example.sh`
